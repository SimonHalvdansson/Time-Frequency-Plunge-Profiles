# Companion repository to "Empirical plunge profiles of time-frequency localization operators"

This repository contains code to repeat the main experiment of the paper. Inside the `LTFAT` folder, `plunge_profile.m`  contains the code for the main figures in the paper. For the figure comparing different windows, use the `acc_spec_color.m` routine.

The python file `f(k)_plot.py` contains a numerical verification of Proposition 2.2 which was used to produce Figure 1 in the paper.
